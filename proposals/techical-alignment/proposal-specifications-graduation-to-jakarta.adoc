# Innovations Graduate to Jakarta

Under this proposal specifications ready for standardization are proposed as Jakarta specifications via Creation Review defined by the Jakarta EE Specification Process (JESP).

 - API is repackaged into the `jakarta` namespace as currently defined by the Jakarta EE Specification Committee
 - Vendors may ship and support the prexisting `org.eclipse.microprofile` package to provide optional compatibility
 - Once a MicroProfile innovation is submitted and accepted (passes creation review), its Github repository is frozen

Pros:

 - Consumers will have a clear rule to follow that stands the test of time
 - Greater clarity in community goals helps consumers better understand Jakarta EE / MicroProfile relationship and synnergy
 - Maximum ability to attract intended audience of those willing to try cutting edge apis and do not necessarily care about standards
 - Less community conflict arising from those pursuing stability and those pursuing experimentation

Cons:

 - MicroProfile will see change associated with adapting to package renames
 
# Long-term Effects

Number of projects could become very low at times.

# Open Questions

 - When do we cut over to the `jakarta` version of the specification?
