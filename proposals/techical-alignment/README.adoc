# MicroProfile and Jakarta EE Technical Alignment

MicroProfile was founded in 2016 as a compliment to Java EE, aimed at "driving innovation for future standardization" around microservices. Free from backwards compatibility, the vision was to provide a place where vendors and users combined can experiment, make mistakes, learn together, reinvent and reach stablization much faster.

The initial vision was proven APIs would be standardized via the JCP process.  In August 2017 the Eclipse MicroProfile community submitted MicroProfile Config to the JCP as link:https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=382[JSR-382].  Quotes around the time reinforced the vision and anticipated relationship to the JCP.

After the move of Java EE to Eclipse as Jakarta EE, similar thoughts were expressed.

- _"Since both MicroProfile and Jakarta EE are managed by Eclipse Foundation, the specifications defined under MicroProfile (e.g. MicroProfile Fault Tolerance) could be submitted to Jakarta EE and eventually standardized."_ - Emily Jiang, 2018-09-03, https://jaxenter.com/understanding-jakarta-ee-series-ibm-148922.html[Understanding Jakarta EE: “We can treat MicroProfile as a sports car and Jakarta EE as a minibus”]

The underlying consensus being that MicroProfile innovations are not standards.  Users who use MicroProfile and vendors who implement it must understand the goal is not stability, but innovation.  Breaking changes will occur.  Innovation is prioritized over stability.

# Proposals for Standardization

After Jakarta EE 9 ships Jakarta specifications, which are standards, will want to benefit from the innovations of MicroProfile.  The critical question is what is the 2020 answer for how a MicroProfile specification becomes a standard.
